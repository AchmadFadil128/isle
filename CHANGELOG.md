## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The island in the GNOME top bar: compact, alert and open presentations
  with spring-driven morphs and a black top bar it blends into.
- Music with cover art, scrubber, controls and synced lyrics (LRCLIB).
- GNOME notifications in the island, a Notifications page and Do Not Disturb.
- Pomodoro focus timer with phase chips.
- Tasks as a plain list with a daily reset of finished tasks: a progress
  ring, an always-ready add field, rename by clicking a title, and finished
  tasks folded under "Completed".
- File shelf with drag and drop through the `isle-shelf` helper.
- Alerts for charging, battery, losing the connection, Bluetooth, volume,
  brightness and Caps Lock.
- Privacy dots for the camera, microphone and screen sharing; a screen
  recording timer with a stop button.
- Volume and output device switching on the music page.
- Daily focus totals and Do Not Disturb during focus sessions.
- Rubber-band stretch when the volume is pressed past its limit.
- Clipboard history and notes on the Shelf page (Clipboard · Notes · Files):
  cards with search and type filters, click to copy, Super+V and Enter to
  paste, pin to Notes, hand-offs to Tasks and Files; password managers and
  chosen apps are ignored.
- Right-click brings the music player to the front.
- GNOME's calendar drop-down no longer appears alongside the island.
- Shelf files can be removed with × even without the `isle-shelf` helper.
- The focus timer, and Do Not Disturb during focus, survive the lock screen
  and an `isled` restart.
- `isled` D-Bus service, install and uninstall scripts, product spec and
  D-Bus API docs.
